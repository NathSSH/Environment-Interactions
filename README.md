# Environment-Interactions
Interact with some props.

This is my current mod project. I'm not sure if I can finished making this mod, because if I add some new props to interact, the game crashes if I go inside the Fun House Fun. Is this because the game limitations? Or something else? Idk

Whats has been done:
- School rooftop (wheelbarrows, bells, and scaffolds)
- Fun House Fun (ladder, reapers, maze door, miners, and curtains)
- Trees (trees that can fall, like when on mission Lola's Race)
